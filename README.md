# Cpp_BODMAS_Calculator

This is a BODMAS Calculator written in C++ using the stack data structure.

Firstly, an expression is taken as input from the user and it is checked for validity. If the expression is invalid, the user will be prompted to input again.

If the input expression is mathematically correct, then this expression is converted to the postfix notation, also known as the Reverse Polish Notation, using stack data structure.

Following this, the postfix expression is evaluated using stacks again.
